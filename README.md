# Jetpack-Compose-Video-Games-Example :video_game:

This is a simple video games discovery app showcasing UI using Jetpack Compose and also tests for composable UI.

This application gets all it's data from [RAWG API][rawg].

## Building the project :hammer: :wrench:

To successfully build this application you need an API key from [RAWG][rawg].

Head on over there and follow the steps to get your key. It's completely free!

Once you get your API key, edit your `local.properties` file and add the key as follows:

`api.key=YOUR_API_KEY`

## Future scope :crystal_ball: :soon:

 - Add filter functionality
